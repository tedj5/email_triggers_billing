          Hi, (insert first name), <br />
          <br />
          We hope you’ve been enjoying Yobi, and are just letting you know that
          your monthly (yearly) (Plan type) plan was successfully renewed. A
          copy of a detailed invoice can be found here <a href="#">[URL]</a>.
          <br />

          As a reminder your (Plan type) plan renews on (next payment day), you
          will be charged (amount), unless your plan changes before that time.
          If your plan does change in the next month (or year), you will be
          charged based on your new plan. Thanks, Team Yobi
          <br />
        </p>
